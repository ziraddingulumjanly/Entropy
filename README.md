# ENTROPY
entropy (n.)
according to the [1] in1868, from German Entropie "measure of the disorder of a system," coined 1865 (on analogy of Energie) by German physicist Rudolph Clausius (1822-1888), in his work on the laws of thermodynamics, from Greek entropia "a turning toward," from en "in" (see en- (2)) + tropÄ“ "a turning, a transformation" (from PIE root *trep- "to turn"). The notion is supposed to be "transformation contents." Related: Entropic.

Entropy in machine learning refers to a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a dataset, particularly in the context of decision trees. It quantifies the amount of information contained in a dataset, with higher entropy indicating more unpredictability and lower entropy signifying more certainty or order. In decision tree algorithms, entropy helps determine how to split data at each node. The goal is to create branches that reduce entropy by grouping similar data together. A low entropy split means the data is more homogeneous, helping the model make more confident predictions. This process is key to building efficient decision trees.
