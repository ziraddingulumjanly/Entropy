### Entropy (n.)

According to the [Etymology Online](https://www.etymonline.com/word/entropy#:~:text=entropy%20%28n.%29%201868%2C%20from%20German%20Entropie%20%22measure%20of,a%20transformation%22%20%28from%20PIE%20root%20%2Atrep-%20%22to%20turn%22%29), entropy was coined in 1865 by German physicist Rudolph Clausius (1822-1888) on the analogy of the term "Energie." It is derived from the Greek word *entropia*, meaning "a turning toward," from *en* (in) and *tropÄ“* (a turning, a transformation). It refers to a measure of the disorder of a system, where the notion is "transformation contents." Related term: *Entropic*.

Entropy in machine learning refers to a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a dataset, particularly in the context of decision trees. It quantifies the amount of information contained in a dataset, with higher entropy indicating more unpredictability and lower entropy signifying more certainty or order. In decision tree algorithms, entropy helps determine how to split data at each node. The goal is to create branches that reduce entropy by grouping similar data together. A low-entropy split means the data is more homogeneous, helping the model make more confident predictions. This process is key to building efficient decision trees.
